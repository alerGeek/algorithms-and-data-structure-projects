# AISD-projekty
Project was written as my own practise for classes AISD on University if Technology in Lublin.

It consist a exercises, where we had to use correct best of chosen algorithms.  Project has been written as c++ with polish names of variables, as it has been one of requirement of tasks :)
Unfortunatly, I do not have the exercies description anymore, so only what is left is code.
